Hello neglected project! I got a reminder that this should be properly
finished. Found some errors in the draft code, updated the text about
what the blocks in the test cases are and fixed missing index for first
block. Need to update the draft at IETF too.

Thanks for Jeffrey Walton for feedback.

The draft has been submitted, see:
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-strombergson-chacha-test-vectors/

The generator could still be a bit more polished, but is basically done.
